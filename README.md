# Exploratory-data-analysis--Hotel booking dataset
Exploratory data analysis on hotel booking dataset from Kaggle 
## Why this dataset?
This is an an extreme long dataset, with close to over 30 attributes. I have switched from a conventional way of merely creating an anlysis to finding a real-life objective for this dataset. As I have just started running a discord server for data analytics, I will like to use this project as an exercise for them and for me as well. Hence, I have set an objective which is to report the finding of this analysis to the marketing manager. The manager in this case will be our infamous Michael Gary Scott. Our insights will help Michael make great decision for his team, hopefully.
